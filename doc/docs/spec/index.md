# Vapor Programming Language Specification

This document is meant as a reference specificaion for Vapor multiparadigm programming language. It defines the lexical
conventions, grammar of the language, and semantics of language constructs. Since the language is not yet in a working
condition, and will keep evolving (at least syntax-wise) for a long time, keep in mind that this document will also
change and may periodically be out of sync with the actual state of implementation contained in the same repository as
this specification.

This document also explains the concepts and constructs in an informal way, although it is not intended as a "gentle
introduction" to the language; that kind of documentation will be prepared once there actually is an implementation of
the language.
